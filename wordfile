My current romantic partner names Alice Le. We have been dating for more than for years up to now. Speaking of stages, I believe that we have been on many of those stages, except the last one. 
1.	At the first day we met, which is the initialing stage, we had been friends before at that moment, but we donâ€™t really talk to each other. At this stage, we basically introduce ourselves and couple more information about careers.
2.	When we start get to know each other a bit better, which is Intensifying Stage. I asked her about some more specific topics such as her jobs and her experience on things. The most important thing that I found at this stage is that we stopped being too formal to each other like before.
3.	After couple months, this time was around New Year Eve. We started to party with friend and officially announced that we are a couple. After that, we spent a lot of time together and moved in together .This stage can be considered as Bonding Stage.
4.	We really thought that things will go on well forever. However, after couple months, we started to care about individual more than both. We both could tell that we became less benevolent to each other on many certain topics that we usually agree with each other back in the day. The important point that marks this stage is that we freely show each other our carelessness without an attempt to hide it. This stage can be considered as Differentiating Stage.
5.
